# Shelf View

Last updated: 2026-04-21
Status: Implemented (see **Implementation Decisions Journal** at the bottom for deviations taken during implementation)

A new terminal presentation mode that sits alongside Canvas. Where Canvas spreads
worktrees out as flat cards and weakens the worktree concept, Shelf preserves and
strengthens it: each worktree (or plain folder) becomes a "book" with a vertical
spine that doubles as its tab bar. Exactly one book is "open" at any time,
occupying the space between a left stack of already-passed spines and a right
stack of upcoming spines.

---

## Mode & Entry Point

- Shelf is a terminal-region presentation mode, **mutually exclusive** with
  Canvas. The left navigation remains visible in Shelf mode (Shelf only occupies
  the terminal region to the right of the navigation).
- The Shelf toggle lives next to the Canvas toggle in the same toolbar `HStack`,
  placed immediately to the **right of** (i.e. after) the Canvas entry.
- Toggle hotkey: **`Cmd+Shift+Enter`** — symmetric with `Toggle Canvas`'s
  `Cmd+Option+Enter`.
- **Exit Shelf**: only by re-clicking the Shelf toggle (or pressing the toggle
  hotkey). Clicking a different worktree in the left navigation does **not**
  exit Shelf — it merely changes which book is open. (This differs from Canvas,
  where left-nav clicks exit the mode, because Canvas weakens the worktree
  concept while Shelf treats `book = worktree` 1:1.)

---

## Concept Mapping

| Shelf concept | Prowl model |
|---|---|
| Book | A worktree or a plain folder |
| Spine | The book's vertical tab bar; also carries its identity (worktree/folder name + branch) |
| Open book body | The terminal surface (with splits) of the book's currently active tab |

**Order of books on the shelf** equals the order of worktrees / plain folders in
the left navigation. Reordering happens through the left nav, not on the shelf.

---

## Layout Invariant

The terminal region (everything to the right of the left navigation) is split
into three horizontal segments:

```
[ left spine stack ] [ open book terminal area ] [ right spine stack ]
```

Let `N` be the index of the currently open book among all books `1…last`:

- **Left stack** = spines of books `1…N`, in book order. Book `N`'s spine is the
  rightmost in the left stack and sits flush against the left edge of the
  terminal area.
- **Terminal area** = the surface of book `N`'s currently active tab (with the
  existing split logic).
- **Right stack** = spines of books `N+1…last`, in book order, flush against
  the window's right edge.

**Initial state on entering Shelf**: `N` is the worktree currently identified by
`WorktreeTerminalManager.selectedWorktreeID`; the open book's active tab is
that worktree's currently active tab (no separate Shelf-only tab memory).

**Book set = opened worktrees/folders only**: the spines shown on the Shelf
are *not* the full list of worktrees + plain folders in the sidebar. The
Shelf only includes books the user has interacted with at least once in
the current session — i.e., those with an associated terminal state. A
worktree that appears in the left navigation but has never been clicked (or
touched by CLI / layout restore) does *not* get a spine. Clicking an
as-yet-unopened worktree in the left navigation while Shelf is active is
what makes its spine materialize — the normal spine-flow animation applies
as the new spine slides into its sidebar-order position.

---

## Spine Specification

### Geometry

- **Width**: one line of text (compact, fixed across all spines and across
  open/closed states).
- **Identical structure and width whether the book is open or closed**; only
  the area to the spine's right changes (terminal surface vs. nothing).

### Header (top of spine)

- Worktree name + branch name, rendered **rotated 90°** (vertical reading
  direction).
- For **plain folders** (no branch): only the folder name is shown, with the
  branch line entirely omitted (consistent with how plain folders are presented
  in the left navigation today).
- The header is **not** part of the scrollable area (see Tab List Overflow).

### Tab List (below header)

- Each tab is rendered as **its icon only** (Prowl already supports per-tab
  custom icons). No label text in the slot.
- Each slot is a uniform-sized clickable target.
- **Hotkey overlay**: when the user holds **⌘ (Command)**, the icon in each
  slot is **replaced** by the tab's `Cmd+N` digit (1–9). Slot size and position
  do not change — there is zero layout shift. This matches Prowl's existing
  "hold ⌘ to reveal hotkeys" behavior.
- For tabs at index ≥ 10 (no `Cmd+N` hotkey): when ⌘ is held, the slot continues
  to show the icon (optionally slightly dimmed to hint "no hotkey"); details left
  to implementation.

### Tab List Overflow

- When the tab list does not fit the available spine height, the **tab list
  area scrolls vertically**.
- The header (worktree/branch) stays **pinned** and does not scroll.
- The bottom controls (see below) also stay pinned and do not scroll.

### Bottom Controls

- A row of three buttons at the spine's bottom: **`+` / vertical split /
  horizontal split**, mirroring Prowl's standard tab bar.
- These controls are **only shown on the spine of the currently open book**.
  Closed-book spines do not show them (acting on a non-open book first requires
  opening it).

### Per-Tab Visual States (must all be respected, simultaneously when applicable)

- **Active tab highlight** — the book's currently selected tab.
- **Notification highlight** — drives off the existing
  `WorktreeTerminalState.hasUnseenNotification(for:)`. Visual: **slot
  background tint**, using the same color/style as Canvas title-bar
  notification highlights (reuse the existing token / style for consistency).

### Book-Level Aggregated Notification

- When **any** tab in a book has an unread notification, a **small dot badge**
  is shown on the spine **header** (next to the worktree/branch text).
- Purpose: when a notifying tab is scrolled out of view in the spine's tab
  list, the user can still see at a glance "this book has activity".
- No directional arrow / no "scroll up to see" hint — keep it minimal.

---

## Open Book Visual Distinction

The open book's spine is visually distinguished from other spines through a
**combination** of:

- An **accent color / contrasting background tint** on the open book's spine,
  and
- **Visual continuity** with the terminal area: the spine and terminal area
  share background color and/or border treatment so the spine reads as "the
  left edge of the open page" — reinforcing the book metaphor.

(Active-tab highlight on the spine's currently-active tab slot is a separate,
**tab-level** signal, independent of the **book-level** open-book signal.
Both can be visible at once.)

---

## Interaction

### Book ↔ Left Navigation Sync (bidirectional)

- **Shelf → Left nav**: clicking a different spine in Shelf updates
  `selectedWorktreeID` (and therefore the left-nav selection).
- **Left nav → Shelf**: while in Shelf mode, clicking a worktree in the left
  navigation triggers the same spine-flow animation as clicking that book's
  spine directly. The Shelf does not exit.

The single source of truth for "which book is open" is `selectedWorktreeID`.

### Switching Books (clicking a non-open book's spine)

Clicking spine `M` (where `M ≠ N`):

- If the click lands on a specific tab slot `T` on spine `M`: animate the
  spine flow (rules below), open book `M`, and set `M`'s active tab to `T`.
- If the click lands on the spine **header** only: animate the spine flow,
  open book `M`, keep `M`'s previously active tab.

**Spine flow rules:**

- **`M > N` (forward)**: spines `N+1…M` slide from the right stack into the
  tail of the left stack. Spines `M+1…last` do not move.
- **`M < N` (backward)**: spines `M+1…N` slide from the left stack back to the
  head of the right stack. Spines `1…M-1` do not move.

In both cases the previously open book's spine ends up wherever the flow
places it (no special case).

### Switching Tabs Within the Open Book

Clicking a tab slot on the **currently open** book's own spine:

- **No spine animation, no page-turn transition.** The spine layout is
  unchanged.
- The terminal area is replaced with the newly selected tab's surface.

### Unified Click Rule

Every tab slot on every spine is a click target meaning "switch to this book
and this tab". Whether the click triggers spine-flow animation depends solely
on whether the targeted book is already the open book.

### Creating Tabs / Splits

- Use the **bottom controls** (`+` / vsplit / hsplit) on the **open book's**
  spine, or the existing keyboard shortcuts.
- To add a tab to a non-open book: open it first by clicking its spine, then
  use the bottom controls.

### Closing Tabs

Mirror Prowl's normal-mode tab close behavior:

- **Hover X**: hovering a tab slot reveals a small X button to close it.
- **Right-click menu**: right-clicking a tab slot opens a tab-level context
  menu containing Close (and any other existing tab actions).
- **`Cmd+W`** keyboard shortcut continues to close the active tab.

### Closing the Last Tab in a Book

Closing the last tab does **not** remove the book from the shelf. Instead, the
book remains, its spine stays in place, and the open area shows an **empty
terminal placeholder UI** (consistent with normal-mode behavior). The user can
add a tab back via the bottom controls (after opening the book).

### Removing a Book from the Shelf

A book is removed from the shelf only by:

1. **Closing/removing the worktree** through the left navigation (existing
   pathway), or
2. **Right-clicking the spine header** → context menu → **"Remove book"**.

Right-click scoping:

- Right-click on a **tab slot** → tab-level context menu (Close, etc.).
- Right-click on the **spine header or its empty body area** → book-level
  context menu (Remove book, etc.).

## Animation Specification

### Axis 1 — Spine flow character

- **Snappy**: ~200ms, ease-in-out. Crisp, minimal hang time.

### Axis 2 — Terminal area swap

- Use SwiftUI **`matchedGeometryEffect`** (or the closest equivalent): the
  terminal area is treated as a piece of "openable book content" that
  geometrically transforms together with its spine.
- During transitions, **two terminals may coexist briefly** in the terminal
  region:
  - **Forward (`M > N`, "pulling in")**: book `M`'s terminal slides in from
    the right alongside `M`'s spine. The previously open book `N`'s terminal
    stays in place and **fades out** as `M`'s terminal arrives, so the user
    never sees a half-clipped or partially-replaced surface.
  - **Backward (`M < N`, "pushing out")**: book `N`'s terminal slides out to
    the right alongside `N`'s spine and **fades out** during the slide. Book
    `M`'s terminal materializes at its destination (slide-in or fade-in, as
    looks best in implementation).
- **Unified rule**: the "about to be invisible" terminal handles the fade; the
  "about to be visible" terminal stays opaque (slide-in) or fades in. This
  prevents surface views from popping in / out abruptly and avoids visual
  tears against the moving spines.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All Shelf-related shortcuts are **configurable** through Prowl's existing
keybinding system (`scope = configurableAppAction`), exposed in
`Settings → Shortcuts`.

| Command | Default binding | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `toggleShelf` | `Cmd+Shift+Enter` | New command. Symmetric with `toggleCanvas` (`Cmd+Option+Enter`). |
| `selectTerminalTab1…9` | `Cmd+1..9` | **Existing** commands. In Shelf, they switch tabs within the open book. |
| `selectPreviousTerminalTab` / `selectNextTerminalTab` | `Cmd+Shift+[` / `Cmd+Shift+]` | **Existing** — apply within the open book. |
| `selectNextWorktree` / `selectPreviousWorktree` | Unchanged: `Cmd+Ctrl+↓` / `Cmd+Ctrl+↑` | Unchanged. See `selectNext/PreviousShelfBook` below for the `Cmd+Ctrl+→` / `Cmd+Ctrl+←` bindings on the Shelf. |
| `selectNextShelfBook` / `selectPreviousShelfBook` | `Cmd+Ctrl+→` / `Cmd+Ctrl+←` | **New commands**. Operate on the ordered Shelf-book list (worktrees + plain folders), which can diverge from the worktree list if plain folders are interleaved. See the Implementation Decisions Journal for why we took this over a two-binding alias on the worktree commands. |
| `selectShelfBook1…9` | `Ctrl+Option+1..9` | **New commands**, deliberately distinct from `selectWorktree1..9` (`Ctrl+1..9`). Books and worktrees are not 1:1 in numbering: "books on the shelf" can diverge from "items in the left navigation" (e.g. presence/absence on the shelf, plain-folder ordering). Shelf-specific. |

### Implementation note on multi-binding

The current `KeybindingSchema` / `AppShortcut` / `Binding` model holds a single
`shortcut` per command. The `Cmd+Ctrl+←/→` alias for
`selectNext/PreviousWorktree` requires a non-trivial extension to support a
collection of bindings per command (and to surface that in the settings UI).
If this cost proves prohibitive, the fallback is to introduce wrapper commands
(e.g. `selectNextBookAlias`) that invoke the same underlying action, at the
cost of duplicating rows in the shortcuts settings list.

---

## Mapping to Existing Models

- The ordered list of spines mirrors the ordered list of worktrees + plain
  folders tracked by `WorktreeTerminalManager`.
- Each spine's tab list mirrors that worktree's `TerminalTabManager` tabs.
- The terminal area renders the active tab's `GhosttySurfaceState` (and any
  splits) using the existing surface-rendering path.
- `WorktreeTerminalManager.selectedWorktreeID` ↔ "the open book", driven by
  spine clicks and left-nav clicks alike (single source of truth).
- Per-spine tab-slot notification highlights consume
  `WorktreeTerminalState.hasUnseenNotification(for:)`.
- Per-book aggregated header dot consumes
  `WorktreeTerminalState.hasUnseenNotification` (book-wide).

---

## Open Implementation Questions (non-blocking)

- Spine height budget per slot, and the exact dimming treatment for tabs ≥ 10
  when ⌘ is held.
- Exact accent color / continuity treatment for the open book's spine + terminal
  area (decide during visual implementation; iterate if it looks off).
- Whether the spine should auto-scroll to reveal a newly-arriving notification
  (vs. relying solely on the aggregated header dot).
- Multi-binding architectural change (see Keyboard Shortcuts → Implementation
  note) — design before implementation.
- Empty-state visuals for an empty Shelf (no books at all).
- Animation behavior under user interruption (e.g. clicking a third spine while
  a transition is mid-flight).

---

## Implementation Decisions Journal

Decisions made during implementation that deviate from — or add nuance to —
the earlier design, recorded for review.

### Keyboard Shortcuts: wrapper commands over multi-binding

**Design spec** had `Cmd+Ctrl+→` / `Cmd+Ctrl+←` as a second alias on the
existing `selectNext/PreviousWorktree` commands, with a note that this
requires a non-trivial extension to the keybinding schema (singular
`shortcut` → collection).

**Implemented** as distinct `selectNextShelfBook` / `selectPreviousShelfBook`
commands. Reasons:

- The Shelf-book ordering includes plain folders (interleaved per
  `orderedShelfBooks()`), so "next book on the Shelf" is not semantically
  equal to "next worktree" when plain folders exist. Aliasing would have
  skipped plain folders when a user pressed the arrow alias.
- The wrapper-command approach keeps `AppShortcut.Binding.shortcut` singular,
  avoiding the schema change.
- Both commands still live in `Settings → Shortcuts` so users can remap
  either set independently.

### Commands plumbing: merged into `SidebarCommands`

Originally planned as a separate `ShelfCommands: Commands` struct. Moved into
`SidebarCommands` because SwiftUI's `@CommandsBuilder` caps the number of
direct children in a `.commands { }` block; adding a new top-level Commands
struct pushed the builder past the cap and triggered a compile error on
unrelated `CommandGroup`s. Merging keeps the external menu footprint the
same (two visible toggles + one Worktrees menu).

### `isShelfActive` as a separate flag

`RepositoriesFeature.State` gained a new `isShelfActive: Bool` flag instead
of adding a `.shelf` case to `SidebarSelection`. Reason: Shelf is a
presentation mode that still needs `selection` to track a worktree or plain
folder (the open book). Using a dedicated flag decouples "is Shelf active"
from "which book is open", which lets the bidirectional sync with the left
navigation fall out for free.

### Auto-exit rules

Entering Canvas or Archived Worktrees from any entry point clears
`isShelfActive` — those two presentation modes are mutually exclusive with
Shelf by design. Entering Shelf from Canvas / archived redirects selection
to a compatible worktree / plain-folder before flipping the flag.

### Terminal rendering in the open area

Rather than reusing `WorktreeTerminalTabsView` (which includes the horizontal
tab bar), we introduced `ShelfOpenBookView` — a leaner view that renders only
the terminal content stack + icon picker sheet + window focus observer. In
Shelf, the tab bar lives on the spine, so duplicating it would violate the
design.

### Plain folder spines

`ShelfBook` uses `Worktree.ID` as its identity. For plain folders this is
the repository ID, matching the synthetic worktree emitted by
`RepositoriesFeature.State.selectedTerminalWorktree`. That way
`openShelfBookID == selectedTerminalWorktree?.id` for both kinds without
special-casing.

### Animation: `.animation(value:)` for both entry points

To make left-nav-originated book switches animate identically to
Shelf-originated taps, the root `HStack` carries an explicit
`.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2), value: openBookID)` modifier.
Shelf-originated taps additionally pass the same animation to
`store.send(_, animation:)` so the TCA-side mutation carries the transaction
along.

### Close-last-tab behavior

The empty-book state falls out naturally: `ShelfOpenBookView` already
renders `EmptyTerminalPaneView(message: "No terminals open")` when
`selectedTabId == nil`. The spine remains on the shelf, with its bottom
controls still enabling new tab / split to recover.

### Opened-worktrees set

`RepositoriesFeature.State.openedWorktreeIDs: Set<Worktree.ID>` tracks
which worktrees/plain folders are currently part of the Shelf's book list.
It's updated by the reducer in three places:

- `.selectWorktree(id, _)` handler inserts `id` (covers user click in
  sidebar, Shelf click, CLI open, layout restore)
- `.selectRepository(id)` handler inserts `id` when the repository is a
  plain folder (same semantics for plain folders)
- `.toggleShelf` entry path inserts the currently selected ID when the
  selection is already compatible with Shelf (rare path, but guards
  against state that was set without going through the two actions above)

`orderedShelfBooks()` filters against this set. The set is pure
additive in this iteration — archived / removed worktrees still drop off
the Shelf because the book iteration is anchored on the live
`repositories` array, not on `openedWorktreeIDs`. That leaves a handful
of stale IDs in the set but no visible spines; pruning can be layered in
later if the set grows unbounded.
