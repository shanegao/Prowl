# 014 — Terminal Layout Persistence: Action Log

## Timeline

| Date | Change | Ref |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-03-27 | Font-size override persisted as `GlobalSettings.terminalFontSize`; synced from cell-size callbacks, normalized against the Ghostty default, injected at boot | PR #77 |
| 2026-03-27 | Cmd+0 reset propagated via `GHOSTTY_ACTION_CONFIG_CHANGE` → `onConfigChange` bridge callback so new tabs pick up the cleared override | PR #81 |
| 2026-03-31 | Phase A: cache moved to App Support (+ legacy migration), `PathPolicy`, `snapshotPersistencePhase` write guard, snapshot fuses, `restoreTerminalLayoutOnLaunch` toggle + clear action | PR #112 |
| 2026-04-01 | Phase B: `TerminalLayoutSnapshotPayload`, persistence client I/O, `WorktreeTerminalManager` save/restore orchestration, tab/split tree reconstruction, `AppFeature` lifecycle hooks | PR #113 |
| 2026-04-01 | Umbrella merge to main: both phases + `LaunchRestoreMode`, terminate-time save, Advanced Settings toggle (~700 lines of tests) | PR #116 (closes #76) |
| 2026-04-01 | Plain folders restore via `selectRepository`; "Clear saved terminal layout" gates re-saving through `suppressLayoutSaveUntilRelaunch` | PR #120 → [010-plain-folder-support](../010-plain-folder-support/000-plan.md) |
| 2026-04-01 | Font-size stability across worktree switches: surfaces marked `font_size_adjusted` (via `increase_font_size:0`) so keybind-config reloads don't reset fonts; Cmd+0 freed for `reset_font_size` by dropping tab-0/worktree-0 shortcuts | PR #121 |
| 2026-04-01 | Restore no longer skipped when the boot snapshot matches disk state: `repositoriesLoaded` always emits `repositoriesChanged` on the `.restoring` → `.active` transition | PR #122 |
| 2026-04-02 | Safeguards from #123: restored split ratio clamped to `[0.1, 0.9]`; `layoutRestoreFailed` event → warning toast when a snapshot is reset | PR #125 |
| 2026-04-08 | Tab title and icon persisted in the snapshot (optional fields, backward-compatible decode) | PR #186 → [022-tab-title-and-icon](../022-tab-title-and-icon/000-plan.md) |
| 2026-06-01 | Default View launch race + restoration hang fix | PR #380 — see [002-launch-restore-races.md](002-launch-restore-races.md) |
| 2026-06-16 | scenePhase-save-clears-snapshot launch race fix | PR #459 — see [002-launch-restore-races.md](002-launch-restore-races.md) |

## Outcome & current state (as of 2026-07-12)

- `supacode/Features/Terminal/Models/TerminalLayoutSnapshotPayload.swift` —
  `currentVersion = 2`; fuses `maxWorktrees = 128`, `maxSplitNodesPerTab = 1024`,
  `maxSplitDepth = 24`; `SnapshotWorktree` → `SnapshotTab` (`title`, `customTitle`,
  `icon`) → recursive `SnapshotSplitNode`. The v1→v2 migration promotes a v1 `title` to
  `customTitle` — v2 arrived with persistent custom tab titles
  ([022-tab-title-and-icon](../022-tab-title-and-icon/000-plan.md)), which split the live
  shell title from the user override that #186 had stored in one field.
- `supacode/Clients/Terminal/TerminalLayoutPersistenceClient.swift` — load/save/clear
  with `maxSnapshotFileBytes` and validity checks; invalid snapshots are deleted.
- `supacode/Features/Terminal/BusinessLogic/WorktreeTerminalManager.swift` —
  `persistLayoutSnapshot()` (async, from the `.saveLayoutSnapshot` command) and
  `persistLayoutSnapshotSync()` (from `applicationWillTerminate` in
  `supacode/App/supacodeApp.swift`); `restoreLayoutSnapshot` emits `.layoutRestored` /
  `.layoutRestoreFailed` terminal events and clears the snapshot on failure.
- `supacode/Features/Terminal/Models/WorktreeTerminalState+LayoutSnapshot.swift` —
  per-worktree serialization and tab/split-tree reconstruction; restored split ratios
  are clamped to `[0.1, 0.9]` (#125).
- `supacode/Features/App/Models/LaunchRestoreMode.swift` — gained a third case,
  `cliOpenPath(String)`, for `prowl open` cold launches
  ([013-prowl-cli](../013-prowl-cli/000-plan.md)), beyond the two planned modes.
- `supacode/Features/App/Reducer/AppFeature.swift` — `launchRestoreMode` is derived from
  the setting at init and consumed once on `repositoriesChanged`; the
  inactive/background save is gated on the setting, `suppressLayoutSaveUntilRelaunch`,
  and `launchRestoreMode != .restoreLayout` (#459).
- `supacode/Support/PathPolicy.swift`, `supacode/Support/SupacodePaths.swift` — path
  policy and the App Support cache location
  (`…/com.onevcat.prowl/cache/terminal-layout-snapshot.json`) with legacy `~/.prowl`
  migration.
- `supacode/Features/Settings/Models/GlobalSettings.swift` —
  `restoreTerminalLayoutOnLaunch` (still default `false`) and `terminalFontSize`;
  the toggle + clear button live in
  `supacode/Features/Settings/Views/AdvancedSettingsView.swift`, still labeled
  "(experimental)".
- Font size: `WorktreeTerminalManager.preferredFontSize` feeds new surfaces;
  `supacode/Features/Terminal/Models/WorktreeTerminalState+Surfaces.swift` still sends
  `increase_font_size:0` after creating an overridden surface so config reloads keep it
  (#121).

User-facing behavior is documented in `docs/components/terminal.md` ("Layout
persistence"), `docs/components/settings.md` (Advanced pane), and
`docs/reference/settings-fields.md`.

## Deviations from plan

- Phase A's repository-snapshot fuses and `PathPolicy` outgrew this feature: they now
  guard the startup cache and worktree cleanup generally, not just layout restore.
- `LaunchRestoreMode` acquired the unplanned `cliOpenPath` case when the `prowl` CLI
  needed to suppress worktree restoration on cold `prowl open` launches.
- The snapshot format needed a version bump (v2) once tab identity work separated live
  titles from user overrides — #186's single-`title` design turned out to be lossy.
- The launch sequencing around restore proved fragile well after the feature stabilized;
  two races surfaced months later (see
  [002-launch-restore-races.md](002-launch-restore-races.md)).

## Open questions

- The feature has shipped enabled-by-hand since 2026-04-01 yet is still marked
  "(experimental)" with default `false`; no recorded decision either promotes or
  retires the experimental label.
