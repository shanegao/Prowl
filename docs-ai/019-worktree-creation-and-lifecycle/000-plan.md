## Background

Worktrees are Prowl's unit of parallel agent work: each agent session normally lives in
its own git worktree created from the New Worktree dialog. By April 2026 the inherited
creation and merge handling had several rough edges:

- The base-ref picker dropped local branches that track a remote (`branchRefs(for:)`
  mapped each local branch to its upstream ref), so the picker looked remote-only
  (fork issue #166).
- Creation used whatever the local remote-tracking refs happened to be — starting a
  worktree from a stale `origin/main` was easy (fork issue #176).
- When a worktree's PR merged, the only automation was a boolean "automatically archive"
  toggle; there was no "delete" option (fork issue #175).
- `copyIgnoredOnWorktreeCreate`, `copyUntrackedOnWorktreeCreate`, and
  `pullRequestMergeStrategy` existed only as per-repo settings, so every repository had
  to be configured individually (fork issue #178).

This entry covers that April wave plus the later lifecycle waves that accreted on the
same flows: worktree history navigation, deletion safety, per-creation placement
overrides, and the redesigned repository intake ("Add to Prowl") popover.

## Goals

- Base-ref options include local branches alongside upstream refs (dedup/sort kept).
- Optional (default-on) `git fetch <remote>` before worktree creation, resolved against
  the base ref; fetch failure logs and continues — it must never block creation.
- Replace the auto-archive boolean with a `MergedWorktreeAction?` picker: do nothing /
  archive / delete, with legacy settings migration.
- Promote copy flags and PR merge strategy to global defaults with per-repo optional
  overrides (`nil` = use global), shown as "Global (current value)" pickers per repo.

**Non-goals** (initially): per-creation placement control, branch-name suggestion,
deletion-safety rework, clone-from-URL intake — all later waves (see Amendments).

## Design / Approach

- **Base refs** (#167): `GitClient.branchRefs(for:)` returns both the local branch ref
  and its upstream ref instead of collapsing tracking branches into their upstream.
- **Fetch before creation** (#189): global `fetchOriginBeforeWorktreeCreation` (default
  `true`) plus a per-creation toggle in the prompt. After resolving the base ref, match
  it against `git remote` output (longest prefix) and run `git fetch <remote>`; a
  dedicated fetch stage in `WorktreeCreationProgress` surfaces it in the progress UI.
- **Merged worktree action** (#190): `MergedWorktreeAction` enum (`archive`/`delete`),
  optional in `GlobalSettings`; legacy `automaticallyArchiveMergedWorktrees: true`
  decodes to `.archive`, `false` to `nil`. `.delete` dispatches the same
  `deleteWorktreeConfirmed` path as manual deletion and honors the "Delete local branch
  with worktree" setting.
- **Global defaults** (#192): the three settings move into `GlobalSettings` with UI in
  the Worktree and GitHub settings tabs; `RepositorySettings` keeps optional overrides
  and creation/merge logic falls back to the global value when the repo value is `nil`.

## Alternatives & decisions

- **Fork-first despite known upstream overlap**: the 2026-04-08 upstream review (see the
  ledger) had already spotted upstream's own merged-action picker (`4db25220`) and global
  defaults (`ce214902`) in v0.8.0, while the fork branches for #190/#192 were in flight.
  The recorded decision: merge the fork implementation now, and on the next upstream sync
  "prefer upstream's implementation where equivalent; keep fork extensions if any".
- **Fetch is best-effort**: errors append to progress output but never abort creation,
  trading strict freshness for a creation flow that works offline.
- **Delete action reuses the manual path**: automated post-merge deletion goes through
  `deleteWorktreeConfirmed` rather than a separate code path, so safety changes to manual
  deletion (amendment 003) automatically apply to it.
