## Delivered

- Added `AgentRuntimeAdapter`, `AgentRuntimeAdapterRegistry`, structured start/resume requests,
  `AgentInvocation`, and `AgentRuntimeClient`.
- Implemented verified Codex and Claude Code adapters. Start input is shell-rendered only at the
  existing terminal-tab boundary; headless resume runs direct argv through `ShellClient`.
- Promoted lossless process argv to `ForegroundProcess`, derived explicit model/unrestricted launch
  observations during detection, and retained each observation only for the same PID.
- Replaced handoff's hard-coded interactive shell strings with `AgentStartRequest`. Handoff now
  inherits only portable source intent: an explicitly observed unrestricted mode crosses between
  Codex and Claude Code, while a model remains same-adapter only.
- Added source-authored preparation to `handoff save`, `handoff to`, and the Command Palette. An
  exact/high source session is resumed before Prowl saves generated context; completion, failure,
  and skipped preparation are recorded in `log.md` and the CLI payload's `preparation` field.
- Review hardening (same PR): the preparation resume is read-only by construction —
  `AgentResumeRequest` carries no execution mode, the source agent replies with the document
  (Codex via `--output-last-message`, Claude Code via `-p` stdout), and Prowl validates and
  transcribes the reply into `current.md` via `HandoffStore`. One resume turn is bounded by a
  2-minute timeout with child termination; `--no-prepare` skips the turn; `save` records the
  outcome on a single log line; Codex's `--yolo` alias counts as observed unrestricted; the
  Command Palette shows progress/warning toasts during preparation.
- Updated the handoff, CLI, and Command Palette documentation with the safety boundary and
  configuration inheritance rules.

## Verification

- `make check`
- Focused `xcodebuild test` selection covering `AgentRuntimeAdapterTests` (argv, reply file,
  timeout), `HandoffStoreTests` (reply validation/transcription), PID-scoped launch observation,
  `HandoffCommandHandlerTests` (transcription, `--no-prepare`, unusable replies), and Command
  Palette source preparation with toasts: 63 passed.
- `make build-cli`, `make test-cli-smoke`, `make test-cli-integration` (63 passed) for the
  `--no-prepare` flag and payload changes.
- `make build-app`: Debug macOS app built successfully with zero warnings.

## Deliberate limits

Only Claude Code and Codex have verified runtime adapters. Prowl never infers an execution policy
from an absent argv flag, never passes a model identifier across those agent families, never
escalates permissions for a headless resume, and never falls back to a cwd-based session scan.
Unsupported detected agents remain available through `handoff to --no-launch`.
