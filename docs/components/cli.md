## What it is & when to use it

`prowl` talks to a running Prowl GUI app over a Unix socket. Reach for it whenever
the task is to act on a pane **other than the current one** — check a sibling
agent, run something in another tab and grab the output, focus a worktree, open a
project, or close a scratch tab. It is **not** for ordinary editing/building
inside a repo, and not for how-to questions about Prowl's settings.

## Install

From the app: **Settings → Advanced → Install Command Line Tool**, or Command
Palette → "Install Command Line Tool". This symlinks `prowl` into
`/usr/local/bin` (prompting for admin if needed).

## Global options

- `--json` — emit structured JSON (recommended for automation). Each command's
  JSON has a `schema_version` like `prowl.cli.list.v1`.
- `--no-color` — disable colored text output (implied by `--json`).

Success envelope: `{ "ok": true, "command": "...", "schema_version": "...", "data": {...} }`.
Error envelope: `{ "ok": false, "command": "...", "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`.
Exit code is 0 on success, non-zero on failure. **Parser errors print plain text**
(not JSON) even with `--json`, because parsing happens before execution — always
check the exit code before piping to `jq`.

## Targeting model

Most commands accept one selector (mutually exclusive):

- `--pane <uuid|pN|N>` — a specific pane. `pN` is the short handle shown in
  text output; bare `N` is accepted too.
- `--tab <uuid|tN|N>` — a specific tab (its focused/first pane). `tN` is the
  short handle shown in text output; bare `N` is accepted too.
- `--worktree <id|name|path>` — a worktree (its selected/first tab → focused/first
  pane).
- `-t, --target <value>` — auto-resolve: tries pane UUID, then tab UUID, then
  worktree id/name/path.
- **No selector** → the *current* focus (focused worktree → selected tab → focused
  pane). Some commands (close) refuse this for safety.

**Rules:** at most one selector (else `INVALID_ARGUMENT`); prefer explicit
`--pane`. The focused pane is not stable — `open` and `focus` change it.

Text `list` and `agents` output exposes short, type-prefixed handles such as
`p7` and `t6`. They are valid only for the current app process, are globally
monotonic, and are never reused after a tab or pane closes. Use them with an
explicit `--pane` or `--tab`; `--target` and positional targets deliberately do
not resolve handles because a bare number can be a worktree name. JSON always
keeps the canonical UUID in `id`; do not cache either form across an app restart.

> **Never target by tab title.** Titles are free-form and can lie. For scripts,
> resolve a concrete UUID `pane.id` from `prowl list --json`; for an interactive
> same-session handoff, copy the `pN` handle from text `prowl list`.

## Commands

### `prowl list`
Snapshot of all worktrees → tabs → panes. No selectors.

```bash
prowl list --json
```
Each item contains:
- `worktree`: `id`, `name`, `path`, `root_path`, `kind` (`git`|`plain`|`workspace`)
- `tab`: `id`, `title`, `selected`
- `pane`: `id`, `title`, `cwd`, `focused`, `agent`
- `task`: `status` (`running` | `idle` | null)

`pane.agent` is the coding agent detected in that pane — a stable machine token
(`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor-agent`, …) or `null` when none is detected.
It comes from the same agent detection described in
[agent-detection](agent-detection.md) and is useful for coordinating who is who
(e.g. before a [handoff](#prowl-handoff)).

These are JSON fields, so `tab.id` and `pane.id` remain UUIDs. Plain `prowl list`
instead shows `tN` for each tab and `pN` for each pane; pass either handle back
with the corresponding explicit selector:

```bash
prowl list
prowl read --pane p7 --last 120 --wait-stable
prowl tab close --tab t6 --force
```

`task.status` is **running** when any pane in the worktree is busy — a terminal
command reporting progress, or a detected agent that is Working/Blocked (including
Claude running a background **workflow**); otherwise **idle**. See the
[worktree running indicator](agent-detection.md#worktree-running-indicator). It's
good for coordination but lags a screen by ~2–3 s and can flip to idle **before** a
TUI finishes painting — confirm with `read --wait-stable`.

Find your own pane (to avoid operating on yourself):
```bash
self_pane="$(prowl list --json | jq -r '.data.items[] | select(.pane.focused==true) | .pane.id')"
```

### `prowl agents`
Snapshot of detected agent panes, matching the Active Agents roster. No
selectors.

```bash
prowl agents --json
```
Each agent contains:
- `id`: the pane/surface UUID, suitable for `--pane`.
- `type`, `name`: normalized detector type and displayed command name. Aliases
  such as `omp` are preserved in `name`.
- `status`, `raw_state`: detected agent state. `status` is one of `blocked`,
  `working`, `done`, `idle`; `raw_state` is the lower-level detector state.
- `last_changed_at`: ISO-8601 timestamp for the most recent state change.
- `project`: display-oriented `name`, `branch`, `path` resolved from the
  agent's working directory.
- `worktree`, `tab`, `pane`: the actual terminal owner and pane metadata for
  automation.
- `session`: optional native agent session metadata. When resolved, it contains
  `id`, local transcript `path` (may be null when the id comes from a non-file
  artifact), `confidence` (`exact`, `high`, or `medium`), and the evidence
  `source` (`open_file`, `process_log`, `transcript_match`, `recent_file`, or
  `store_record`). Ambiguous sessions are omitted instead of guessed. A
  `medium` session id must not be used for automatic resume/fork without
  additional confirmation.

`prowl agents` is read-only. To jump to or operate on an agent, resolve
`.data.agents[].pane.id`, then use existing commands:

```bash
pane="$(prowl agents --json | jq -r '.data.agents[] | select(.status=="blocked") | .pane.id' | head -n1)"
prowl focus --pane "$pane"
prowl read --pane "$pane" --last 120 --wait-stable
```

Text output is sorted for triage: `Blocked`, `Working`, `Done`, then `Idle`.
It prints a pane handle such as `p7` for each agent; use it as
`prowl read --pane p7`, not as an `agents` subcommand. Empty output prints
`No agents found.`.

### `prowl read [target]`
Read a pane's content.

- `--last <n>` — last N lines (scrollback + screen); omit for a full snapshot.
- `--wait-stable` — re-read until the screen stops changing (best for live TUIs).
- `--stable-interval <50–5000ms>` (default 200), `--stable-period <100–60000ms>`
  (default 800), `--wait-timeout <1–300s>` (default 10) — tune the stable wait.

```bash
prowl read --pane "$pane" --last 200 --wait-stable --json
```
Response includes `mode` (snapshot|last), `source` (screen|scrollback|mixed),
`truncated`, `line_count`, `text`, and (when waiting) `stabilized`, `waited_ms`,
`samples`. **`truncated: false` with fewer lines than `--last` just means the pane
has less history — don't retry.** `truncated: true` flags a possibly-incomplete
read.

### `prowl send [target] [text]`
Type into a pane, optionally wait for completion and capture output.

- Text source: argv, or stdin if no argv (don't provide both → `EMPTY_INPUT`).
- `--capture` — wait and capture the command's output (screen diff). **Requires
  OSC 133 shell integration** on the target; sends a trailing Enter; **cannot**
  combine with `--no-wait` or `--no-enter`.
- `--no-wait` — fire and forget.
- `--no-enter` — pre-fill text without submitting (submit later with `key enter`).
- `--timeout <1–300s>` — wait budget (default 30).

```bash
prowl send --pane "$pane" 'npm test' --capture --timeout 60 --json   # run & capture
prowl send --pane "$pane" 'long-task' --no-wait --json               # don't wait
printf '%s\n' 'echo a' 'echo b' | prowl send --pane "$pane" --capture # stdin
```
Response: `input` (source/characters/bytes/trailing_enter_sent), `wait`
(`exit_code`, `duration_ms`) when waiting, and `capture` (`text`, `line_count`,
`truncated`) when capturing. If the pane lacks shell integration you get
`CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED` — drop `--capture` and use `read --wait-stable`, or redirect
the command's output to a file and `cat` it.

### `prowl key [target] [token]`
Send a keystroke.

- `--repeat <1–100>` — repeat the key.
- Tokens: named keys (`enter`/`return`, `esc`, `tab`, `backspace` — `delete` is an
  alias for backspace; use `delete-forward` for a forward delete — `space`, arrows
  `up`/`down`/`left`/`right`, `pageup`/`pagedown`, `home`/`end`,
  `f1`–`f12`, punctuation), single characters (`a`–`z`, `0`–`9`, etc.), and
  modifier combos joined with `-`: `cmd`/`command`, `shift`, `opt`/`option`/`alt`,
  `ctrl`/`control` — e.g. `ctrl-c`, `cmd-k`, `shift-tab`, `cmd-shift-p`.

```bash
prowl key --pane "$pane" enter --json
prowl key --pane "$pane" down --repeat 10 --json
```

### `prowl focus [target]`
Focus a worktree/tab/pane and bring Prowl to the front.

```bash
prowl focus --pane "$pane" --json
prowl focus --worktree MyApp --json
```

### `prowl tab create`
Create a new terminal tab (deterministic — unlike `open`).

- `--path <dir>` — working directory (must be inside the worktree root).
- Selectors choose the worktree (defaults to current).

```bash
pane="$(prowl tab create --worktree "$wt" --json | jq -r '.data.target.pane.id')"
```

### `prowl tab close` / `prowl pane close`
Close a tab or a pane. **Require an explicit selector** (`--tab`/`--pane`/
`--worktree`/`--target`) — they intentionally do **not** default to the focused
pane. If the target has protected agent work or a long-running command, Prowl may
ask for GUI confirmation; `--force` skips it (use only after positively
identifying the target).

```bash
prowl pane close --pane "$pane" --json
prowl tab close --tab "$tab" --force --json
```

### `prowl open [path]` (the default command)
Navigate Prowl to a path (or bring it to front with no argument). It may focus an
existing pane or create a tab — it is **not** a deterministic "new pane" command.
For a guaranteed fresh shell, use `tab create`.

```bash
prowl open ~/projects/app     # open/focus that project
prowl open                    # just bring Prowl forward
```
Supports `~` and `file://`. Reports `resolution` (no-argument / exact-root /
inside-root / new-root), `app_launched`, `brought_to_front`, `created_tab`, and a
`target`.

### `prowl handoff`
Manage the cross-agent handoff artifact under a target's `.prowl/handoff/` and
launch the receiving agent. Centred on [workspaces](workspaces.md), but works for
any runnable target. Three subcommands:

```bash
prowl handoff save       [target] [--note "…"] [--no-prepare]   # refresh context + session excerpt
prowl handoff to <agent> [target] [--note "…"] [--no-launch] [--no-prepare]
prowl handoff status     [target]
```

- **`save`** — when Prowl has an exact or high-confidence native session for
  the detected outgoing Claude Code or Codex process, it first resumes that
  session non-interactively (read-only, bounded to 2 minutes) and asks it to
  **reply** with a fresh agent-authored `current.md` snapshot, written
  entirely from that session's own knowledge; Prowl validates the
  reply and transcribes it into the file (the previous version is backed up
  to `archive/` first). It then refreshes
  `.prowl/handoff/context.md` from live git state (per-repo branch + change
  counts, changed-file list, detected outgoing agent, and captured session
  excerpt). The single `save` log line records whether source preparation
  completed, failed, or was skipped. `--no-prepare` skips the source turn for a
  fast mechanical refresh. `current.md` is seeded from a template on the first
  run; Prowl only rewrites it to transcribe a validated preparation reply.
- **`to <agent>`** — performs the same safe source preparation, saves, archives
  the current artifact to `.prowl/handoff/archive/<ts>-<from>-to-<to>.md`, and
  launches the receiving agent in a **new tab** with a semantic kickoff prompt
  for `current.md` and generated `context.md`. Returns the launched `pane`.
  An observed unrestricted source execution policy is translated between the
  verified Claude Code and Codex adapters for the destination launch only;
  model identifiers remain with their original agent family. `--no-launch`
  still prepares, archives, and saves; `--no-prepare` skips the source turn.
  Interactive launch is verified for `claude` and `codex`; `--no-launch`
  accepts the full detected-agent list: `pi`, `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`,
  `cursor-agent`, `cline`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `kimi`, `droid`, `amp`,
  `qodercli`, `qwen`, `grok`.
- **`status`** — report the artifact path, whether it exists, the agent
  currently detected in the target, and the last handoff-log line.

```bash
prowl handoff to claude --json     # codex → claude, launch claude in a new tab
prowl handoff save --note "ui done, api next" --json
```

The outgoing agent is whatever Prowl detects in the target's pane (see
`pane.agent` in [`list`](#prowl-list)). Response payload includes `action`,
`artifact_path`, `outgoing_agent`, `to_agent`, `repos`, `changed_file_count`,
`archived_path`, `session_context`, `preparation` (`completed` / `failed` /
`skipped`, for `save` and `to`), and `launched_pane`. `session_context` includes
the generated excerpt path plus native `session_id` / `transcript_path` only when
the selected pane already has unambiguous native-session evidence (the same
identity exposed by `prowl agents`). When no session is resolved, Prowl keeps the
terminal excerpt and omits native metadata. Unsafe or ambiguous native sessions
are never resumed: source preparation is skipped and any existing `current.md`
(or its template) remains the durable artifact. Full feature guide:
[handoff](handoff.md).

The generated `.prowl/handoff/` directory contains its own `.gitignore`, so its
artifacts and terminal excerpts do not appear in `git status`.

After a target has an existing `.prowl/handoff/current.md`, the app also
auto-runs the same save path when Prowl sees the detected agent move from
**working** to **done** or **blocked**. This auto-save is throttled per pane and
does not initialize handoff files by itself; use `prowl handoff save` or
`prowl handoff to` once to opt the target in.

## Transport & app launch

- Socket: `~/Library/Application Support/com.onevcat.prowl/cli.sock` (override with
  `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET`). If that primary path would exceed the AF_UNIX 104-byte
  limit (e.g. a very long home-directory path), it falls back to
  `$TMPDIR/prowl-cli.sock`.
- If the app isn't running, the CLI launches it (`open -a Prowl`) and waits up to
  ~15s for the socket — except when `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET` is set.
- Sandboxed agents must be allowed to connect to the Unix socket. If the CLI
  reports `SOCKET_PERMISSION_DENIED`, allowlist the socket path in the agent
  sandbox, run `prowl` outside that sandbox, or start both the app and CLI with
  the same `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET` pointing at a sandbox-accessible path.
- Framed protocol: 4-byte length prefix + JSON, both directions.

## Error codes

| Code | Meaning / recovery |
|------|--------------------|
| `APP_NOT_RUNNING` | Prowl is not reachable, or the socket is missing/stale. Start or restart Prowl, then retry. |
| `SOCKET_PERMISSION_DENIED` | The socket exists but the client cannot connect, usually because a sandbox blocked the Unix socket. Allowlist the socket path, run outside the sandbox, or use matching `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET` values for both app and CLI. |
| `TARGET_NOT_FOUND` | Selector matched nothing — re-run `list` and pick a UUID or current short handle. |
| `TARGET_NOT_UNIQUE` | Selector matched several — be more specific (use `--pane`). |
| `NO_ACTIVE_PANE` | No pane for focused-target; pass an explicit `--pane`. |
| `EMPTY_INPUT` | `send` got neither argv nor stdin (or both). |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Bad flag/combo (e.g. `--capture --no-wait`) or out-of-range value. |
| `CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED` | Target lacks OSC 133 — drop `--capture`, use `read --wait-stable`. |
| `WAIT_TIMEOUT` | Command didn't finish in time — raise `--timeout` or use `--no-wait`. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_KEY` / `INVALID_REPEAT` | Check `prowl key --help`. |
| `PATH_NOT_FOUND` / `PATH_NOT_DIRECTORY` / `PATH_NOT_ALLOWED` | Fix the `open`/`tab create` path. |
| `LAUNCH_FAILED` | App launch or socket wait failed; the message includes the last socket diagnostic when available. |
| `TRANSPORT_FAILED` | Socket transport failed for a reason other than app availability or permission, such as `ENOTSOCK` or an invalid `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET` path. |
| `*_FAILED` (`LIST_FAILED`, `AGENTS_FAILED`, `FOCUS_FAILED`, `SEND_FAILED`, `READ_FAILED`, `TAB_FAILED`, `PANE_FAILED`, `OPEN_FAILED`, `HANDOFF_FAILED`) | The action itself failed. |

## Safety & self-targeting

- If your shell runs **inside a Prowl pane**, the focused pane is probably *you*.
  Identify and avoid it (the `self_pane` snippet above) so you don't `key enter`
  into your own session.
- Close commands require explicit targets and may prompt for GUI confirmation on
  protected work; `--force` bypasses the prompt.

## A complete loop (run, read, clean up)

```bash
self_pane="$(prowl list --json | jq -r '.data.items[]|select(.pane.focused==true)|.pane.id')"
pane="$(prowl tab create --worktree MyApp --json | jq -r '.data.target.pane.id')"
test "$pane" != "$self_pane"
prowl send --pane "$pane" 'swift build' --capture --timeout 300 --json
prowl read --pane "$pane" --last 100 --wait-stable --json
prowl pane close --pane "$pane" --json
```

## Gotchas for agents (quick list)

- Resolve a UUID `pane.id` or current text `pN` before `read`/`send`/`key`/
  `focus`/close — never trust tab titles.
- Use `prowl agents --json` when you need agent status; use `prowl list --json`
  when you need all panes, including ordinary shells.
- `--capture` needs shell integration; otherwise `read --wait-stable` or file
  redirection.
- `open` is navigation, not a guaranteed new pane — use `tab create`.
- In zsh, don't name a variable `status` (it's readonly).
- Pass shell values into `jq` with `--arg`.
