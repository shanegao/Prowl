# Changelog

## [2026.4.15](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.15)

## New

- **Fetch before worktree creation**: Prowl can now run `git fetch` against the relevant remote before creating a new worktree. The option is on by default and can be toggled in Settings > Worktree. Fetch errors are logged but do not block worktree creation.
- **Merged worktree action**: The "auto-archive on merge" toggle has been replaced with a three-option picker — Do Nothing, Archive, or Delete — controlling what happens to a worktree when its pull request is merged. Find it in Settings > Worktree. Existing configurations migrate automatically.
- **Global defaults for copy flags and merge strategy**: The "copy ignored files", "copy untracked files", and "pull request merge strategy" settings can now be configured once as global defaults in Settings, with optional per-repository overrides. Repository-level pickers show the current global value when no override is set.

## Fixed

- Terminals could appear blank after exiting Canvas view due to the surface losing its host attachment. Prowl now detects and recovers from this state automatically.

## [2026.4.11](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.11)

This release focuses on worktree management improvements and quality-of-life fixes.

## New

- **Auto-delete archived worktrees**: A new setting in Worktree Settings lets you configure a period (1, 3, 7, 14, or 30 days) after which archived worktrees are deleted automatically.
- **Reveal in Sidebar**: Press Shift+Cmd+L to scroll the sidebar to the currently selected worktree, expanding its repository section if collapsed.
- **Archived worktrees discoverability**: Archive confirmation dialogs now tell you where to find archived worktrees (Menu Bar > Worktrees, or Control+Cmd+A). A "View Archived Worktrees" entry is also available in the command palette.

## Fixed

- Restored terminal surfaces no longer spin the CPU and GPU when they are not displayed, keeping resource usage low for non-visible tabs after session restore.

## [2026.4.9](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.9)

Tab layout and Worktrees menu discoverability are the main themes of this release.

## New

- All worktrees and plain folders now appear in the Worktrees menu, regardless of count. Previously only the first 9 were shown. Items beyond the 9th no longer have keyboard shortcuts but remain reachable via the menu or **Help > Search**.
- Manually renamed tab titles and icons are now saved in the terminal layout snapshot and restored when the layout is reloaded.
- Added Homepage and Release Notes links to the Help menu and sidebar footer.

## Fixed

- Plain folders were missing from the Worktrees menu entirely; they now appear in the same order as the sidebar.

## [2026.4.7](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.7)

**Fixed**

- When using a transparent background (`background-opacity < 1`) in dark mode on macOS 26, the titlebar and window border now correctly appear dark-tinted instead of showing an unwanted light glass effect.
- The sidebar footer now displays a proper frosted glass effect when the background is transparent, rather than a plain semi-transparent fill that let the wallpaper bleed through without blur.
- When creating a worktree, the base branch picker now includes local branches alongside their upstream counterparts. Previously, tracked local branches were omitted, making the picker appear to only support remote refs.

## [2026.4.6](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.6)

This release brings a redesigned sidebar with a modern, cleaner, and more compact layout, along with reliability fixes across the terminal surface and CLI.

## New

- **Redesigned Sidebar** — the sidebar has been completely re-laid out for a modern, cleaner, and more compact look, giving you more room to focus on your work.
- **Reveal in Finder** is now available in the worktree context menu, opening the worktree directory directly in Finder.
- The run script indicator (green play icon) now shows a red stop button on hover; clicking it stops the running script.
- The tab count badge on repository headers now shows a tooltip with the active tab count when hovered.
- CLI tool install and uninstall results now show a toolbar toast on the main window for all entry points (Command Palette, menu bar), so you always get feedback regardless of whether Settings is open.
- `prowl key` now correctly emits ANSI control characters for `Ctrl-[`, `Ctrl-\`, `Ctrl-]`, `Ctrl-^`, and `Ctrl-_` combos, and uppercase letters preserve their shift meaning.

## Fixed

- Hovering a worktree row no longer causes a vertical layout jump when pin and archive buttons appear.
- Archive, Delete, pin, and archive buttons are now hidden for the main worktree, where those actions do not apply.
- Terminals could appear blank after exiting Canvas view due to occlusion state being applied before the surface was reattached to the view hierarchy; this is now deferred correctly.

## [2026.4.5](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.5)

Prowl gains a command-line tool for scripted terminal control.

### New

- **`prowl` CLI**: Control Prowl from the command line with `open`, `focus`, `send`, `read`, `list`, and `key` commands. Run `prowl --help` to get started.
- **Install the CLI from within the app**: Go to Settings > Advanced, the Prowl menu, or the Command Palette (Cmd+P) and choose "Install Command Line Tool" to add `prowl` to `/usr/local/bin`.
- **Auto-launch on `prowl open`**: If Prowl is not running when you invoke `prowl open <path>`, it launches automatically and then opens the requested path.
- **Auto-target resolution**: All selector commands (`focus`, `send`, `read`, `key`) now accept a positional `<target>` argument or `-t`/`--target` flag. Pass any pane UUID, tab UUID, or worktree name and Prowl resolves the type automatically.
- **`prowl send --capture`**: Snapshots the screen buffer before and after command execution and returns the diff as captured output, useful for scripted workflows that need to inspect command results.
- **Layout restore warning**: When a saved terminal layout snapshot cannot be restored, Prowl now shows a warning in the toolbar instead of silently resetting.

### Fixed

- Clicking anywhere on the Canvas row in the sidebar (including padding) now correctly selects Canvas. Previously only the icon and label text were responsive.
- Exiting Canvas could leave the terminal blank until you switched away and back. The surface state is now refreshed immediately on Canvas exit.

## [2026.4.2](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.4.2)

Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts and persistent terminal layout across app launches.

### New

- **Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts**: A dedicated Shortcuts page in Settings gives you complete control over every key binding in Prowl. Remap app actions, terminal tab and pane navigation, split management, and the command palette to any key combination you prefer. The editor records shortcuts directly from your keyboard, detects conflicts with existing bindings inline, and lets you replace or cancel on the spot. Whether you are a Vim user remapping splits or just want `Cmd+T` to do something different, every shortcut is now yours to define.
- **Terminal layout restore**: Prowl now remembers your full terminal layout — tabs, splits, and their arrangement — and restores it exactly when you relaunch. Enable "Restore Layout on Launch" in Settings > Advanced, and your workspace is back in seconds, no matter how complex the setup. Use "Clear saved terminal layout" to reset to the default empty state whenever you want a fresh start.
- **Custom commands revamp**: The repository custom commands editor is now a fully inline-editable table with an SF Symbol icon picker, shortcut recording, and no cap on the number of commands. Commands beyond the first three appear in a toolbar overflow menu.
- **Script environment variables**: Scripts run by Prowl now receive `PROWL_WORKTREE_PATH` and `PROWL_ROOT_PATH` environment variables (renamed from the old `SUPACODE_` prefix).
- **Window menu additions**: Tab and pane selection shortcuts are now accessible from the Window menu.

### Fixed

- Font size no longer resets when switching between worktrees or when Ghostty reloads its config due to custom command changes.
- `Cmd+0` (reset font size) now affects the current pane only; new tabs inherit the reset size. The old tab-0 and worktree-0 shortcuts (`Cmd+0` / `Ctrl+0`) have been removed to free up these key combinations.
- Terminal layout restore now works correctly for plain folders and correctly suppresses re-saving after clicking "Clear saved terminal layout."
- Pane focus is correctly restored after toggling zoom on a split pane.
- Scripts running in fish shell no longer hang due to an `exit $?` incompatibility.

## [2026.3.28](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.28)

Persistent terminal font size and freed-up keybindings.

### New

- Terminal font size now persists across sessions. Prowl saves your preferred size and restores it when you relaunch. Font size controls are available in the View menu.
- Cmd+0 has been freed from its previous font-size binding, making it available for custom Ghostty keybindings.

### Fixed

- Plain folder repositories now show the correct open tab count in the sidebar header.

## [2026.3.27](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.27)

Sidebar tab count badges and Homebrew distribution.

### New

- The sidebar now shows a small tab count badge next to each repository name, reflecting the total number of open terminal tabs across all worktrees for that repo. The badge appears automatically when tabs are open and disappears when none remain.
- Prowl is now available via Homebrew: `brew install --cask onevcat/tap/prowl`. Updates are also delivered through the tap automatically.

## [2026.3.25](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.25)

Canvas multi-select broadcast input — select multiple terminal cards and type once to send the same input to all of them.

### New

- Canvas multi-select: Cmd+Click to select multiple cards, Cmd+Opt+A to select all. Selected cards show a visual distinction between primary (accent ring) and followers (subtle tint).
- Broadcast input: typing in the primary card mirrors committed text and special keys (Enter, Backspace, arrows, Tab, Escape, Ctrl+key) to all selected follower cards.
- IME-safe broadcast: followers receive only committed text (e.g. 你好), not intermediate phonetic input (e.g. nihao). Works correctly with Chinese, Japanese, and other input methods.
- Cmd+V paste and right-click Paste are broadcast to all selected cards.
- Cmd+Backspace (delete line) and Cmd+Arrow (line navigation) are broadcast to followers.
- Escape clears broadcast selection. Click a follower to promote it to primary without clearing selection.

### Fixed

- Terminal scrollback position is now preserved during output, preventing unwanted scroll jumps.
- Cmd+W now correctly closes the focused surface in Canvas mode.

## [2026.3.24](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.24)

Plain folder support and several UX and stability improvements.

### New

- Plain folders can now be added alongside Git repositories. They open directly into terminal tabs with their own toolbar, settings, and command palette entries. Git-only actions are hidden when a plain folder is selected. Folders are automatically upgraded to Git repositories when a `.git` directory is detected, and conservatively downgraded when it is removed.
- Hotkey actions for archive and delete worktree are now scoped to the sidebar, preventing accidental triggers from the terminal. Close Window (⌘W) now works when no terminal is focused, and Show Window (⌘0) brings the main window to front.
- App size reduced by approximately 7 MB thanks to an optimized YiTong web bundle.
- Added diagnostic logging for scroll jump events to help investigate an intermittent snap-to-bottom issue during scrollback reading.

### Fixed

- Exiting Canvas could leave terminal surfaces blank. Occlusion state is now correctly restored whenever a surface is reattached, regardless of how the transition happened.
- The Settings toolbar no longer shows an unnecessary separator on macOS 26.

## [2026.3.23](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.23)

Canvas double-click navigation and smoother card animations.

### New

- Double-click a card's title bar in Canvas to switch directly to that tab's normal view. First click focuses the card with immediate visual feedback, second click switches the view.
- Canvas Arrange and Organize now animate smoothly when repositioning cards.

### Fixed

- Blank terminal surface when exiting Canvas via the toggle shortcut.

## [2026.3.22](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.22)

Command finished notifications and Canvas notification highlights.

### New

- Command finished notifications now alert you when a long-running terminal command completes. Configure the duration threshold in Settings.
- In Canvas, unseen notifications now highlight the entire title bar of the affected tab card, tracked per-tab for better granularity.
- Notifications are automatically marked as read when you type into the focused terminal, and command finished notifications are suppressed if you've recently interacted with that terminal.
- Terminal key repeat now works immediately — the macOS press-and-hold accent menu is disabled in terminal surfaces.
- Updated the embedded terminal engine to Ghostty v1.3.1.
- VSCodium is now recognized as a supported editor.

### Fixed

- Worktree selection is now cleared when entering Canvas mode, preventing stale focus state.

## [2026.3.21](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.21)

Ghostty keybindings and actions that previously had no effect now work in Prowl.

### New

- You can now rename a tab or terminal surface title from the command palette or a bound key. "Change Tab Title" locks the title until you clear it; "Change Terminal Title" sets the surface title and resumes auto-updates when cleared.
- "Open Config" now opens your Ghostty configuration file in the default text editor.
- Fullscreen (`toggle_fullscreen`), maximize (`toggle_maximize`), and background opacity (`toggle_background_opacity`) Ghostty actions now work as expected. Opacity toggling requires `background-opacity < 1` in your Ghostty config and has no effect in fullscreen.
- The `quit` action now routes through the standard macOS termination flow, so any confirm-before-quit prompt still triggers. `close_window` closes the window containing the active terminal.

### Fixed

- The command palette no longer shows duplicate or inapplicable entries (removed redundant "Check for Updates", single-window actions like "New Window", Ghostty debug tools, and iOS-only actions).

## [2026.3.20](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.20)

Faster and more reliable startup with snapshot-based repository restore.

### New

- Repositories now appear immediately on launch by restoring from a local snapshot cache, rather than waiting for the full live refresh to complete. The cache is stored at `~/.prowl/repository-snapshot.json` and is always followed by a background refresh to stay up to date.
- Worktree discovery now runs in parallel across all repositories, and the bundled `wt` tool is invoked directly instead of through a login shell, reducing startup latency.

### Fixed

- Prowl no longer deletes `~/.supacode` on first launch when co-installed with Supacode. Migration now copies data to `~/.prowl` instead of moving it.

## [2026.3.19](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.19)

Canvas improvements: better card layout, smarter focus behavior, and a keyboard shortcut to toggle the view.

### New

- Press `⌥⌘↩` to toggle Canvas view. The command has also moved to the View menu.
- Canvas now auto-arranges cards on first entry using a masonry-style packing algorithm, which produces a more compact, better-scaled layout.
- When entering Canvas, focus automatically returns to the card you were last working on. When exiting, focus restores to the exact worktree and tab you had active inside Canvas.
- Added notification settings for focus events, allowing you to control when Prowl alerts you about focus changes.

### Fixed

- File paths containing Unicode characters (e.g., Chinese filenames) were not shown correctly in diffs and untracked file lists.

## [2026.3.18.2](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.18.2)

Canvas layout and polish improvements.

### New

- Added an "Arrange" button to the Canvas toolbar that automatically lays out cards in a waterfall pattern, making it easy to tidy up a crowded canvas.
- Increased the default card size and raised the maximum resize limit, giving more room to work with agent output at a glance.

### Fixed

- The Canvas toolbar title no longer appears as a tappable navigation button.
- The Canvas sidebar button label is now properly centered, and no longer bleeds through overlapping content when scrolling.

## [2026.3.18](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/releases/tag/v2026.3.18)

Initial public release of Prowl, rebranded from Supacode.

### New

- Prowl is now the app's name and identity, with an updated app icon to match.
- Sparkle auto-update support is included, so future releases will be delivered automatically.
